###Readme for final
1. the code, compiler_sol.dats, runtime.h and testing_ground.c does type check and compiles
2. the code does run, but it is a incomplete implementation of a compiler for t1erm to boxed c-representation
3. there are some testing code near the bottom of the compiler_sol.dats file and testing_ground.c
4. the tested code from testing_ground.c is generated from the output of compiler_sol.dats (with one minor tweaking in the fun function). 
5. the instructions generated by the dats file is based on the runtime.h file, and by default the dats file outputs to the terminal however it can be changed
by changing the fileref argument.
6. Presentation is also available on the following link:
