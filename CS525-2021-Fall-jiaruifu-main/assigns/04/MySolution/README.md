###Readme for assign04
1. Both assign04_sol.dats and isprime.c type check
2. Both codes, assign04_sol.dats and isprime.c, compiles
3. The code does run, I have tested the term0 isprime with assign03's type checker and also tested the c isprime function. I've also included the runtime.h file from lecture 10/27th and added a new function in it.
