###Readme for midterm
1. all three files type checks
2. all three files compiles
3. The code does run, some test code located at the bottom
NOTE: This is based on a copy of MySolution, the original files added in MySolution2 are now located in MS2_backup just in case.
This is because I've made a few changes to the lambda1 and lambda2.dats file in the midterm directory. The changes should be reflected 
in the git repo, and to avoid confusion these fixed solutions still refer to those files instead of the new ones now in MS2_backup
